# B-Nav
The perfect minimalistic navigation bar for your HTML project

## What is B-Nav?
B-Nav is a stylesheet that is designed to create a simple but elegant navigation bar.

## Features
* 2 color themes
* can be created in just 10-15 lines of code
* responsive (mobile and desktop ready)
* lightweight (< 3kb)

## How to Use
1. [Download](https://github.com/1nonlyxtian/b-nav/archive/master.zip) a copy of B-Nav
2. Link the `b-nav.css`, `b-nav.js`, and `jquery.min.js` files to your HTML file
3. At the start of the HTML body, create an unordered list (`<ul>`) with a class of `b-nav` and the chosen color theme (`default` or `inverse`). This will be the framework for your navigation bar.
4. To do the navbar-brand, create an `<li>`, inside it, make a `<p>` with the class `b-nav-brand` and put the name of the brand inside the `<p>`.
5. To do the links, create an `<li>` with the links inside it.
6. Repeat step 5 until necessary
7. Close all tags. (Just a reminder :))

Now you're done! Run the HTML file and you'll find a beautiful, minimalistic navigation bar. :)
